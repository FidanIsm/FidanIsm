      <summary>My Childhood</summary>
      <p>I grew up in Baku, capital of Azerbaijan, located at the shore of Capian sea. When I was 5, my family relocated to Kazakhstan, Almaty city, which is right at the basement of Alatau mountains. Even though I lived in a lot of places afterwards, being close to sea or mountains always fills my heart with joy.</p>
